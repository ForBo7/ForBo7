I'm Salman Naqvi: an approachable, adaptable, open-minded, curious individual who’s been to seventeen countries and lived in three. I’m a science and technology geek, space nerd, and currently dabble in AI. 3D computer graphics is my hobby and learning is my passion.

Over here you'll find various game dev projects of mine, some miscellaneous projects such as implementing algorithms and creating websites, and my ventures into AI and data analysis.
